# Background Image Setup

To add your cat image as the background:

1. Save your cat image file as `cat-background.jpg` in this directory
2. The image should be high resolution (at least 1920x1080) for best results
3. The CSS is already configured to:
   - Make the image cover the entire page
   - Add a translucent white overlay (85% opacity)
   - Ensure all content remains readable
   - Apply blur effects to UI elements for better contrast

## Image Requirements:
- Format: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- Filename: `cat-background.jpg`
- Recommended size: 1920x1080 or larger
- The image will be automatically stretched to fill the page

## CSS Features Applied:
- `background-size: cover` - Image fills entire viewport
- `background-attachment: fixed` - Image stays in place when scrolling
- Semi-transparent overlay for readability
- Glass-morphism effects on UI elements
